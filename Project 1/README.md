# Project 1 - Writing a Data Science Blog Post

## Intro

For this project, I analyzed the Stack Overflow Survey Data for 2017. This data set had over 64,000 developers respond to Stack overflow's annual survey.

There were 3 questions that I wanted to answer from this dataset:
1. Which country has the highest percentage of most years programmed for developers? 
2. Is the job satisfaction for developers higher if they majored in Computer Science as an undergraduate student?
3. Do developers who work at a bigger company have higher salary than those who do not?

## Conclusions

After analyzing the dataset, the conclusions that I drew for the questions were:
1. We found that that country with the highest percentage of most years programmed (which we determined to be 17+ years of programming) was Australia. However, we also noted that Europe had 5 countries within the top 10 countries that we took a look at.
2. We also found that just because a developer majored in Computer Science did not mean that they had a higher job satisfaction. We saw that the percentage per job satisfaction (scale of 0 to 10) was fairly even between CS majors and not.
3. Finally we found that there was a positive correlation between bigger company sizes and average salaries.

## Libraries needed
The libraries that I used for this project are Pandas, Numpy, Seasborn, Matplotlib

## Important Notice
The dataset was over the 25mb requirement for files to be uploaded to Github, so I will include the link to download the dataset below.

The dataset is here [a link](https://www.kaggle.com/stackoverflow/so-survey-2017/data#). <br> <br>
If you would like to run the notebook, please download the dataset and save the csv file in the same directory as the Jupyter Notebook.

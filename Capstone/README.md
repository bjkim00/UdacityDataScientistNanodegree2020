## Intro

For this project, I analyzed the simulated data that mimics Starbucks Data. This data set contains simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app. Once every few days, Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). Some users might not receive any offer during certain weeks. My analysis of this data served a purpose to look at how to improve the profits of the offers that Starbucks gives out to its members by looking at variables like demographic data, or when a member joined the Starbucks membership.

There were 3 questions that I wanted to answer from this dataset:
1. When was the month where the most new members join?
2. What is the average age of the members completing offers? Also, what are the distribution of ages who are more willing to complete offers?
3. What is the distribution of incomes for the members who completed each offer type (BOGO and Discount)?

## Conclusions

After analyzing the dataset, the conclusions that I drew for the questions were:
1. Focus on offering BOGO and Discount offers to the new members signing up in the Autumn or Winter, especially by pairing them with a holiday themed drinks.
2. Focus on sending more offers to members who are in the age range of 58 to 78, as they were the most willing to complete the offers. However, on the opposite end, try to send offers less frequently to members in the 48 to 58 age range.
3. For the BOGO offers, focus on the members with income ranges of $90,000 to $105,000. However, for the Discount offers, focus on sending more offers to members in the income range of $37,500 to $52,500.
